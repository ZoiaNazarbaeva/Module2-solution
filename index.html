          For these delicious recipes, we carefully wrap tall,
          tender pieces of Chicken in a crispy coating,
          and cook them at the perfect temperature to retain all of their flavour.
          Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside: everything you need in your life.

          Aqui Há Peixe means “there’s fish in here” and to honor the name grilled,
          cooked or roasted fish is the most important and special ingredient. 
          Seafood is also available for those who want to be accompanied with the truest taste of the sea.
